Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software systems or applications.
Importance of softaware engineering is that it creates software systems that play a major role of powering up various aspects of modern life like healthcare, banking and finance among others that match with the increasing user needs.


2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages
Advent of structured programming languages.
Introduction of software engineering as a discipline.
Rise of agile methodologies.


3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Requirement analysis. This involves planning for the application by gathering all the necessary requirements before it's actual conceptualisation. Requirements can be derived from user needs or problem aimed to be solved.
b) Design. This is the phase where a high detail design of the application architecture is made and is alligned to user needs.
c) Implementation. Writing code and building software that matches the design made.
d) Testing. Various tests are conducted to make sure that the software implemented matches user needs and requirement specification. It ensures that the software achieves it's intended functionality.
e) Deployment. Software is released to be used by the public or intended sector/industry.
f) Maintenance. Providing additional user support, updates or enhancements to the deployed software.


4.Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a software development or project management method that involves following sequential steps or phases. It emphasizes on a linear progression from beginning to the end. An example is construction. A builder needs to follow some steps during construction like collecting building materials, planning, laying foundation and progressing from one storey to another.
Agile methodology is an iterative(repetitive) approach that breaks down work into smaller units and focuses on regular and collaborative feedback. Projects are delivered in successive cycles with resources dedicated over limited periods of time. An example is applications like Spotify, Microsoft etc


5.Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a) Software developer. Writes code foe softare or application to match user needs and functionality and implements software solutions.
b)Quality assurance engineer. Develops system and format to test the software applications to make sure it measures up to the intended functionality and user needs.
c) Project manager. Oversees all the other roles and responsibilities in the team including planning, execution and delivery of projects. Allocates responsibilities and roles to the various people in a team and also allocates the resources needed.


6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are platforms that provide a simulated environment to create, write, test and deploy codes for software applications e.g Visualstudio. It provides tools for writing, debugging, testing and running code. Version control systems are platforms that provide tools for software tracking of changes to code and a collaborative environment among team members e.g Git and Github. They are important since they enhance productivity, team collaboration and code quality.


7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements. Software requirements are dynamic and change with time. It is hard to keep up with the changes and meet user needs.
Limited infrastructure. Most software engineers and IT companies lack adequate infrastructure to execute projects.
Scalabilty. It is hard to ensure that software applications meet the increasing user demands without affecting perfomance.
Security. It is hard keeping up with threats. There has been an increase in use of AI and Data analytics leading to a threat in cybersecurity.
Tight deadlines. Pressure to deliver quality projects on a tight schedule might compromise quality and perfomance.
   


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the testing of individual co ponents of a software. 
Integration testing is the testing of interactions between related components of a system.
System testing is the testing of the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance system is the testing of a software system against user needs and ensures functionality and perfomance in measure with user needs.
These tests help in identifying and fixing errors and bugs early in the development stage leading to high quality of delivered projects.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of creating language inputs that guide Artificial Inteligence(AI) models to give a desired output. Prompt engineering helps us get desired and effective output from AI models and improves interaction between users and AI models that is humans and machines.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me how the human body works.
This is a cloudy prompt since one is unclear about which part of the human body they want to know or specific process. It is hard for AI to give the desired result.
Clear prompt: Tell me how absorption of food in the small intestines work. 
This prompt is clear snd precise and will give results related to the process of absorption in the small intestines thus outputs desired output.
